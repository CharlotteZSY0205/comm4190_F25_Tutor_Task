AI Tutoring Prompt Experiment
1. Project Overview

This project explores how the use of structured prompting influences the behavior of a large language model (LLM) in an extended communicative task—in this case, a tutoring session.
The objective is to compare two different interaction modes:

A free prompting session, where the LLM is given no specific instructional framework.

A structured prompting session, where the LLM follows a detailed tutoring prompt designed to guide the interaction process.

By analyzing the contrast between these two conditions, the project aims to understand how prompt structure affects the model’s communicative style, cognitive scaffolding, and the learner’s subjective experience of engagement and support.

2. Research Purpose

The task is designed to examine:

How structured prompts shape the LLM’s questioning, feedback, and guidance behavior.

How different prompting conditions influence the learner’s perception of cognitive demand, clarity, and motivation.

How prompt engineering can be used to emulate effective tutoring communication and improve learning outcomes.

├── Session1_FreePrompting.md
├── Session2_StructuredPrompting.md
└── Reflection.md

Session1_FreePrompting.md

Contains the complete conversation with ChatGPT conducted without any structured prompt.
The focus of this session is to observe how the model behaves when given minimal direction and how much cognitive effort is required from the learner to maintain and guide the dialogue.

Session2_StructuredPrompting.md

Documents the second conversation, where the model operates under a structured “Mollick-style” tutoring prompt.
This session emphasizes how structured guidance changes the LLM’s tone, questioning strategies, and ability to sustain a pedagogically meaningful interaction.

Reflection.md

Includes a detailed written reflection on both sessions, comparing the learner’s experience, analyzing communication quality, and presenting a revised version of the tutoring prompt developed from these insights.

4. Method Summary

Conducted two separate 15-minute tutoring sessions with ChatGPT.

Used the same learning topic for both sessions to ensure comparability.

Maintained consistent engagement for the first half of each session, followed by introducing distractions to simulate natural, less-focused learner behavior.

Exported and documented both sessions for textual and linguistic analysis.

Composed a reflection evaluating learning experience, model behavior, and prompt effectiveness.
