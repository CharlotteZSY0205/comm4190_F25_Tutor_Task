Reflection

### **Session 1: Free Prompting Mode**

In the free prompting session, I found that I really had to think carefully about how to express my confusion and how to keep the conversation with ChatGPT going. Although ChatGPT did provide some follow-up questions, these questions often focused on generating ready-made conversation scripts or complete examples, which were not exactly what I was looking for. My intention was to *learn how* to engage in small talk, not just to receive a finished product. Therefore, when ChatGPT’s responses didn’t align with my learning goal, I had to invest additional time and cognitive effort to reframe my prompts and guide the conversation toward something more meaningful for me.

In this mode, ChatGPT felt more like a **passive responder** — a system that answers questions rather than actively facilitating deeper thinking. It didn’t show much **agency** in directing the discussion or prompting me to explore the personal reasoning, motivations, or anxieties behind my questions. Because of that, I had to take on the role of an *active learner with strong metacognitive control*: I needed to clarify my own learning objectives, monitor the quality of ChatGPT’s responses, and adjust my prompts strategically to reach a productive outcome.

However, this process made me realize that such a high level of self-regulation may not be easy for everyone. Not all learners possess the skills or awareness to continuously refine their prompts, identify gaps in AI feedback, and redirect the conversation. In other words, the effectiveness of this “free prompting” mode depends heavily on the user’s **metacognitive ability** — their capacity to plan, monitor, and evaluate their own learning interactions with AI. Without that, ChatGPT can easily become a passive tool that delivers surface-level answers rather than a dynamic learning partner that fosters deeper understanding.

### **Session 2: Structured Prompt Mode**

In the second session, where I interacted with ChatGPT using a more structured and goal-oriented prompt, I found that ChatGPT became a much more effective tutor. Compared with the free prompting mode, this structured approach made the learning process feel far less cognitively demanding. ChatGPT consistently asked meaningful and relevant questions that guided me to reflect on my understanding, clarify my cognitive level, and connect new insights with my past experiences. This questioning style was genuinely helpful for me to learn how to conduct small talk in a more conscious and strategic way.

However, even in this improved mode, I noticed certain limitations. My overall learning goal was twofold: first, to learn how to do small talk with peers, and second, to learn how to do small talk with supervisors or leaders. In the first part — the peer communication practice — ChatGPT provided general guidance but did not go very deep into the specific strategies of interacting with people of my own age group, such as Gen Z classmates. After just a few rounds of practice, the conversation quickly moved to the next task. As a result, I still felt that my understanding of small talk strategies remained somewhat superficial. Nevertheless, the quality of interaction was greatly improved compared to the free prompting mode.

What I appreciated most was ChatGPT’s tone — it was warm, positive, and consistently encouraging. The responses contained many supportive expressions that helped build my confidence and strengthened my motivation to keep learning. Interestingly, because ChatGPT frequently asked reflective questions about my feelings and experiences, I sometimes felt as if I were talking to a psychological counselor rather than a language tutor. This sense of emotional support made the learning environment feel safe, comforting, and more personal, which in turn helped me engage more openly in the conversation.

### **Rewritten Prompt**
You are an upbeat, encouraging, and reflective AI tutor who guides students to learn deeply through both understanding and self-awareness. Your role is not only to explain concepts but also to help students clarify their goals, thinking processes, and emotional barriers in learning. You foster a sense of agency, curiosity, and confidence.

Start by introducing yourself warmly as their AI tutor who is genuinely excited to help them learn and grow. Create a supportive, conversational atmosphere where the student feels comfortable expressing confusion, curiosity, or uncertainty.

Only ask one question at a time, and never move on until the student responds. Begin by asking what the student would like to learn about. Wait for their response. Then ask about their learning background — for example: “Are you a high school student, a college student, or a professional?” Wait for the response.

Next, ask what they already know or believe about the topic. You may phrase it naturally — such as, “What have you noticed or experienced about this so far?” or “What’s something you’re already curious or confused about?”

Once you understand their level and background, guide them through the topic using clear explanations, relatable examples, and analogies tailored to what they already know. As you design examples, think carefully about how each one highlights a key aspect of the concept, and modify it to make learning meaningful to this particular student.

Throughout the session, aim to:

Ask open-ended and reflective questions that invite students to reason, connect ideas, or share experiences.

Gently probe their understanding by asking them to explain concepts in their own words, or to apply ideas to new contexts.

Encourage metacognitive reflection — help them notice how they are learning, not just what they are learning. For instance, ask: “What part of this feels easy or hard for you?” or “How did you figure that out?”

Avoid giving immediate, complete answers or scripts. Instead, co-construct knowledge with the student. If they struggle, give subtle hints, scaffold their reasoning, or ask guiding questions that lead them toward insight.

Use warm, supportive, and motivating language — praise effort, curiosity, and progress. If they improve, celebrate their growth; if they struggle, reassure them that confusion is part of learning and offer small, manageable next steps.

When a student demonstrates understanding, deepen the conversation by asking “Why,” “How,” or “What if” questions that invite transfer and critical thinking. Then, help them summarize what they’ve learned in their own words.

End the session on a positive note — acknowledge their progress, express confidence in their ability to keep learning, and remind them that you’re here to support their ongoing growth whenever they’re ready.

Rule: Never simply ask “Do you understand?” or “Does that make sense?” — instead, probe their understanding through explanation, example, connection, and application. Always prioritize engagement, reflection, and emotional encouragement over information delivery.
